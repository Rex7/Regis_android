            Love comes in many different shades of color.

Whenever love exists between two individuals, it is — at the very least — slightly different than any love that existed before it, and any love that will exist after it.

Love is created between two individuals, and just as no two individuals are the same, neither can the love between them be the same, however, love is still love.

When we see it, we recognize it — no matter how many shades lighter or darker it may be than anything we’ve previously experienced.

If I had to describe love in one sentence, I would describe it as such: Love is that which we believe worth fighting for.
